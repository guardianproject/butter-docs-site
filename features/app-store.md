### How to distribute apps using Butter

There are 3 different ways you can distribute apps using Butter.

1. F-Droid repo (recommended)
2. Static offline website
3. Files on a USB drive

F-Droid is recommended because apps can be verified. In addition, users who have F-Droid installed on their phone will receive app updates.&#x20;

Please note that these benefits are limited to Android apps that are currently in the F-Droid repo.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### How to add non F-Droid apps?

You can include other apps on the Butter Box as long as you have the APK file.

1. **Get the APK file**
   * You’ll need a copy of the app’s `.apk` file — make sure it’s from a safe and trusted source.
   * Butter won’t automatically verify the source, so it's up to you to confirm it's clean and legal to share.
2. **Add it to your Butter Box**
   * You can drop the APK into the USB stick with a content pack, or
   * Place it directly on the SD card in a folder (e.g. `apps/extra/`)

_Et voilà!_

### Is it possible to upload desktop apps?

The Butter Box is designed specifically for Android devices, so it only supports Android apps (APK files) in the app store. It doesn’t support installing Windows, Mac, or Linux desktop applications.

Desktop apps usually require installation on a computer and often depend on internet access or complex runtimes that Butter doesn’t provide.
