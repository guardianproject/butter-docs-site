# Content Packs

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-07-31 at 11.08.36 PM.png>)

When you connect to your Butter Box portal for the first time, the chat/Message Board is shown by default. To display additional content in your portal, connect a USB drive containing the files or content packs that you want.

Content packs are simply a way to share files. They can simply be a set of files bundled together in a folder or it can be content that's displayed in a website layout (as a local static website).

_**Download the sample file** from Quick Start to see a demo of how these two different options work._

### How to Broadcast content from a USB Drive

If you're using a Pi Zero W 2 or another device, you may need to use an adapter [like this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LN3LQKQ/) to plug in a USB drive.

When the drive is plugged in, a new section will appear on the homepage providing the option to view the files an administrator has made available. Users will be able to browse through subfolders, selecting files by name. Files which can be natively displayed in a browser, like images, will display with a click, while other files, like .apk app files, will be downloaded to the device.

Unplugging the USB drive will cause the section on the homepage to disappear.

### Add your own resources to the Butter Box repo

You can put anything you want on your USB drive like your own apps, documents, media, or learning resources. Just add files in the Butter content folders directly on the USB drive.

1. Drop your files or content packs on a USB drive.
2. Plug it into the Butter Box.
3. The system automatically scans and makes them available on the local portal.

### **Adding Static Websites**

If you want to be fancy, you can include an `index.html` in the root folder or any subfolders and it'll be served instead of a directory listing. This provides the opportunity for substantial customization.
