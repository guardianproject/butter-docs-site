Message Board (chat)

* The public room was created by an administrative user called `butterbox-admin`. The password for this user is also `butterbox-admin`.
* Change this password by logging into the Butter Box, going to the public chatroom, then visiting your user profile and updating the password. At your discretion, you may also wish to change the _name_ from `butterbox-admin` so that other users will recognize you.
