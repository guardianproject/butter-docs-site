## Moderating The Public Chat

As the host of The Butter Boxes do have moderation capabilities available to you in the chat or for the message board. In order to access those you need to claim your moderator position!&#x20;

The public room was created by an administrative user called butterbox-admin. The password for this user is also butterbox-admin. Change this password by logging into the Butter Box, going to the public chatroom, then visiting your user profile and updating the password. At your discretion, you may also wish to change the name from butterbox-admin so that other users will recognize you.

1. Login as admin. When you open the message board, you are assigned a Guest identity. You will need to log out from that identity, and log in to the butterbox-admin account.

Once you've done this you can take the following actions:

* **Kick people out.** Though, keep in mind that everyone's identity is a guest name and you may not know who's who. Also, keep in mind that someone can simply rejoin the chat if they reconnect to the box. They can read you in the chat as someone else if they've already been kicked out. If this is the case, you may want to set up a different room and you can do that. It will just be harder for people to find.&#x20;
* **Grant moderator status** to others.&#x20;
* **Set disappearing messages** (eg. Limit history). You can limit the amount of time messages are available in the chat or on the message board&#x20;
* **Remove posts** (?)
* **Delete the room.** Warning: If you delete the room, you will no longer have a public message board on your Butter Box. To get one back, you will have to flash a new image of the Butter Box software to your SD card.
