# Message Board



**Things To Know:**

* There is one on the box that is open to anyone who is able to join the box. So if they can open the portal they can open the chat and say anything that they want or post anything they want.&#x20;



**Moderating the Public Chat**&#x20;

As the host of The Butter Boxes do have moderation capabilities available to you in the chat or for the message board. In order to access those you need to claim your moderator position! Here are the steps to do so...

The public room was created by an administrative user called butterbox-admin. The password for this user is also butterbox-admin. Change this password by logging into the Butter Box, going to the public chatroom, then visiting your user profile and updating the password. At your discretion, you may also wish to change the name from butterbox-admin so that other users will recognize you.



1. Login as admin?
2. Ta-dah!



Once you've done this you can..

* Remove posts
* Kick people out though. Keep in mind that everyone's identity is a guest name and you may not know who's who. Also, keep in mind that someone can simply rejoin the chat if they reconnect to the box. They can read you in the chat as someone else if they've already been kicked out. If this is the case, you may want to set up a different room and you can do that. It will just be harder for people to find.&#x20;
* Set disappearing messages. You can limit the amount of time messages are available in the chat or on the message board&#x20;
