# Box Setups

## Basic

A basic Butter Box setup is a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W with a microSD card running the Butter software, a USB stick, powered by a USB source like a power cord, power bank or solar panel.

In most setups like this, a Butter Box can comfortably handle &#x34;**–10 connected devices at once** without slowing down. It’s possible to have more, but performance may drop if everyone is downloading large files or videos at the same time.

The reach for it is about **5–10 meters** indoors, depending on the Raspberry Pi model and depending on walls and interference. Outdoors, in open space, it can sometimes reach farther. Think of it like the range of a home Wi-Fi router — enough to cover a classroom, a coffee shop, meeting space, or small outdoor gathering.

## Extended

An extended Butter Box pairs the Raspberry Pi with a standalone Wi-Fi router, giving stronger signal and more simultaneous connections. For this option, you’ll want a Raspberry Pi model that has an ethernet port, this means a **Raspberry Pi 4** or a **Raspberry Pi 5**.

To use the router as a hub for the Butter Box, connect the Raspberry Pi to the router by plugging one end of the given ethernet cable into the LAN port and the other into the Raspberry Pi .

With the router, the network can reach **10-30 m**, like a city block or a park, and can comfortably support **10–20 connected devices** at the same time per router (but you can add more routers to it).

This setup is ideal for medium group of people in a medium room, like classrooms, events, or community spaces like a church.

## Different Ways To Power Your Box&#x20;

Butter Boxes can be powered by a wall outlet, pre-charged battery pack or solar powered battery pack.

* **Wall Outlet:** The official and recommended power supply for Raspberry Pi computers (depends of the Raspberry Pi model that you are using)
* **Pre-charged Battery Pack (Power Bank):** This is the most common option for field use.
* **Solar Panel (with Power Bank):** Use a small solar panel to recharge your power bank. This is a good option to keep the box running continuously in off-grid locations. Using direct solar panel without a battery is possible, but unstable if the sun dips in/out.
