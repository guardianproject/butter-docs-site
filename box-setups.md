# Box Setups

## Basic

A basic Butter Box setup is a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W with a microSD card running the Butter software, a USB stick, powered by a USB source like a power cord, power bank or solar panel.

In most setups like this, a Butter Box can comfortably handle **10–15 connected devices at once** without slowing down. It’s possible to have more, but performance may drop if everyone is downloading large files or videos at the same time.

The reach for it is about **10–25 meters (30–80 feet)** indoors, depending on walls and interference. Outdoors, in open space, it can sometimes reach farther. Think of it like the range of a home Wi-Fi router — enough to cover a classroom, meeting space, or small outdoor gathering.

## Extended

An extended Butter Box pairs the Raspberry Pi with a standalone Wi-Fi router, giving stronger signal and more simultaneous connections.

With the router, the network can reach **50–100 m (160–330 ft)** in open areas and comfortably support **25–50 connected devices** at the same time.

This setup is ideal for large classrooms, events, or community spaces where more people need access at once.

To use the router as a hub for the Butter Box, connect the Raspberry Pi to the router by plugging one end of the given ethernet cable into the LAN port and the other into the Raspberry Pi .

## How To Power Your Box&#x20;

Butter Boxes can be powered by a wall outlet, pre-charged battery pack or solar powered battery pack.
