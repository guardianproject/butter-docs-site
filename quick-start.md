You will know the box is working if ‘butterbox’ wifi appears in the wifi list. If it doesn’t, unplug the box and plug it back in.

_If using a solar battery or other means of power, use one with the correct specs to ensure adequate power and avoid damage to the unit. For a Pi Zero 2 W use Micro USB power supply with at least 2.0A._
