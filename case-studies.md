# Case Studies

### 1. Digital Security training to distribute apps and materials

> Leaders from Southern Africa countries travel to provide training, audits, and consultations to organizations about digital security, physical safety, risk assessments, and to equip journalists, activists and human rights defenders with the tools and knowledge to do their job safer. In order to do their work effectively, these leaders need to be able to curate specific types of content to fit various use cases, in different contexts and languages and different formats. In offline situations (load shedding, no access to the internet or in times of internet shutdowns) the ability to successfully deliver trainings and content becomes almost impossible. \

> They shared more than a few times that if they did not have the Butter Box, some sessions would have been canceled.

### 2. Sharing & Media Backup

> Often M. wants to share music and movie files that they’ve downloaded on their computer with their friends — but transferring with cables or Bluetooth is a pain. So they've set up a Butter Box with their media collection — music files, films and photos. They plugged it in near the kitchen, and now anyone in their apartment can connect to the Butter Wi‑Fi and browse a shared media library. No internet needed, and no more file-by-file transfers.

### 3. Temporary file storage

> On a remote site with no cell service, workers needed a way to temporarily offload large files — like site photos or documents — from their phones. Using Butter Box’s local encrypted message board, they sent files to themselves or coworkers for safekeeping. Files stayed on the device until retrieved later, even without power or signal.
