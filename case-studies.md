# Case Studies

### 1. Digital Security training to distribute apps and materials



### 2. Classroom setting to distribute materials

> A teacher running weekly science lessons in an off-grid school needed a simple way to distribute worksheets, videos, and reference apps to students with low-end Android phones. With Butter Box, she created a portable classroom hub — students connected via Wi‑Fi and downloaded weekly content, watched tutorials, and used a science quiz app — all without cell signal or power.

### 3. Sharing & Media Backup

> Often I want to share music and movie files that I’ve downloaded on my computer with my friends — but transferring with cables or Bluetooth is a pain. So I've set up a Butter Box with my media collection — music files, films and photos. I plugged it in near the kitchen, and now anyone in the apartment can connect to the Butter Wi‑Fi and browse a shared media library. No internet needed, and no more file-by-file transfers.

### 4. Distributing news stories and books



### 5. Temporary file storage (if you need to offload from the phone - upload to BB chat)

> On a remote site with no cell service, workers needed a way to temporarily offload large files — like site photos or documents — from their phones. Using Butter Box’s local encrypted message board, they sent files to themselves or coworkers for safekeeping. Files stayed on the device until retrieved later, even without power or signal.
