# About

The internet is essential for modern life, yet access to it remains deeply unequal. Censorship, cost, geographic isolation, and safety concerns prevent many communities from getting online. In these situations, people often rely on lo-fi tools and face-to-face interactions to meet their daily needs.

Butter Box is designed to complement these face-to-face practices. It’s a lightweight, portable device that functions like a hard drive with its own hotspot. Anyone nearby can connect to it and view or download its contents—no internet required.

**Basic Butter Box Specs:**

* **Range:** Approximately 12 feet (5 meters)
* **Capacity:** Supports up to 4 simultaneous connections

By supporting local information sharing, Butter Box helps communities stay informed, connected, and resilient—even without access to the global internet.

## Why You Need it

* **Offline empowerment:** Deploy digital tools in remote, power‑outage, or low‑connectivity environments.
* **Community & education:** Facilitate app sharing, group chats, and local content distribution.
* **Fully self‑contained:** Can be battery or solar powered—ideal for field operations, events, or informal learning zones.
