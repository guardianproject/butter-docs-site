# Get Started

Butter Box is a lightweight, portable device that functions like a hard drive with its own hotspot. Anyone nearby can connect to it and view or download its contentsâ€”no internet required.&#x20;

Whether you have a Butter Box in your hands or you need to build one, you're in the right spot. Choose an option below.

<table data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th></th><th data-type="content-ref"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>I Have A Box</td><td><a href="quick-start/">quick-start</a></td></tr><tr><td>I Need A Box</td><td><a href="build-a-box/">build-a-box</a></td></tr></tbody></table>



**Request a Box Fully Assembled:** We make & ship Butter Boxes to partners around the world. Reach out to us if you serve a community that could benefit.
