# Get Started

Butter Box is a lightweight, portable device that functions like a hard drive with its own hotspot. Anyone nearby can connect to it and view or download its contentsâ€”no internet required.&#x20;

Whether you have a Butter Box in your hands or you need to build one, you're in the right spot. Choose an option below.
