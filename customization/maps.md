# Maps

You can make offline maps available from your Butter Box. These maps are powered by **OpenStreetMap (OSM)** and the **OsmAnd app** for Android.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important:** Offline map downloads work **only on Android devices**. iOS is not supported.
{% endhint %}

### âœ… Steps to Enable Offline Maps

**1. Get the OsmAnd app (APK for Android)**

* Go to: [OsmAnd Free Releases â€” Android](https://osmand.net/docs/versions/free-versions)
* Download the latest APK file.

**2. Download the map files you need**

* Visit: [OsmAnd Local Indexes List](https://osmand.net/list?sortby=size\&asc=false)
* Choose and download the regions you want available offline.

**3. Organize your files**

* On your USB drive, create a folder named  `osm-map-files` .&#x20;
* Put the **OsmAnd APK** and all your **map files** into this folder.
