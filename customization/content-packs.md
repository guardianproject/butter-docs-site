# Content Packs

Content packs are probably the coolest thing spoon sliced bread as it relates to butter. They literally give you endless possibilities.

## Static Websites

With html pages, you can create your own experience around the content you're sharing. To display content through a html page, simply add the html file and it's complementary folders to the jump drive.

**Things to Know**

* When you have the USB drive plugged in, the  _Explore USB_ tile will show up in the portal.
* If a folder on the USB drive contains an html file, the web page will be displayed when the folder is opened.
* If the html file is placed in the root directory, it will be displayed when users tap _Explore USB_ from the portal.
* The html page needs to be available offline. That means that everything (media, pages, fonts, etc) need to be locally available on the box and linked.

**Instructions**

* Drop individual files in the main directory of your USB drive or use a `folder system with the naming of your choice` to organize them.

**Try It!**

Here's an example of a static website: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18wtISjFZdY1NmsDWs7mlmA7UUntJoxAH](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18wtISjFZdY1NmsDWs7mlmA7UUntJoxAH). Add this set of files to your USB drive and give it a spin! If you are sharing files in addition to the static website, place it within a subfolder of the main directory.
