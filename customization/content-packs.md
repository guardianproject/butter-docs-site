### Add html files to your USB drive

Place the html file and associated sub-folders directly in the **main directory** (root) of your USB drive. Or, create a subfolder to place them in. If you're using a subfolder, use the title of the website to name it. This title will be displayed in the Butter Box portal.

{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Connect to your Butter Box to view

Insert the USB drive into your Butter Box. When you open the Butter Box portal, tap **Explore USB**. If your files are in the root directory, this tap will open the static website. If your files are in a subfolder, navigate to the subfolder to open the website.
