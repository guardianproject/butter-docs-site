_If using a solar battery or other means of power, use one with the correct specs to ensure adequate power and avoid damage to the unit. For a Pi Zero 2 W use Micro USB power supply with at least 2.0A._

You will know the box is working if ‘butterbox’ Wi-Fi appears in the Wi-Fi list. If it doesn’t, unplug the box and plug it back in.

{% hint style="info" %}
For a Pi Zero 2 W: Up to 5 people can connect to the box at any time. After people connect and get what they need, encourage them to leave the box to give others a turn.\
The physical reach of the Box varies. But as a rule of thumb, people in the same room as the box (or in talking distance) will be able to access it.
