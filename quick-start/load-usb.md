## Media, Files and Digital Books

If you want to share media, files or digital books, simply drop them onto the USB drive. You can use folders and subfolders to organize your content.

**Things to Know**

* When you have the USB drive plugged in, the 'Explore USB' tile will show up in the portal
* The folder names you use will be displayed in the Butter Box portal

**Instructions**

* Drop individual files in the main directory of your USB drive or use a folder system to organize them.

## Html Pages

With html pages, you can create your own experience around the content you're sharing. To display content through a html page, simply add the html file and it's complementary folders to the jump drive.

**Things to Know**

* If a folder contains an html file, the web page will be displayed in the portal when the folder is opened.
* The html page needs to be available offline. That means that everything (media, pages, fonts, etc) need to be locally available and linked.

**Instructions**

If you have one html file in the main directory, the html page will appear when users tap 'Explore USB' from the portal. If you have multiple folders in the directory, the folders will appear when users tap 'Explore USB'. Once they tap into the folder that contains an hmtl file, that webpage will be displayed \[show video demo].

* Drop individual files in the main directory of your USB drive or use a folder system to organize them.

## Maps

**Things to Know**

* Offline map support is for Android only

**Instructions**

If you want to share offline map files, you need to provide the latest version of Open Street Map for Android, along with the map files for locations of interest.

* Download OSM map apk for Android: [Free Releases — Android | OsmAndosmand.net](https://osmand.net/docs/versions/free-versions/?current-os=ios&)
* Download OSM map files: [Osmand Local Indexes Listdownload.osmand.net](https://download.osmand.net/list.php)

Put these all in a folder named **osm-map-files**. Place that folder on your Butter Box USB drive.

## Apps

There are 3 different ways to share apps from a Butter Box. Visit the [App Store](../features/app-store.md) section to learn which solution is best for you.

**Basic Instructions**

* To get an app store tile to show up, you need to put a folder in your USB directory called **appstore**. The folder must contain one of two things:&#x20;
  1. Required F-Droid files; or
  2. HTML file that links to APK and other app downloads&#x20;
* For more information on sharing apps, visit the [App Store](../features/app-store.md) section.
