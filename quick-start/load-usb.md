When you connect to your Butter Box portal for the first time, the Message Board is shown by default. To display additional content in your portal, connect a USB drive containing the information (files or content packs) you want to share.&#x20;



**Quickly Load Content**

Depending on what content you‚Äôd like to add to your box and how you‚Äôd like it to appear, there are step-by-step instructions to guide you.

* [Media, Files and Digital Books](load-usb.md#media-files-and-digital-books): Use file folders to quickly share media, files and digital books.
* [Maps](load-usb.md#maps): With a few downloads and light file folder organization, you can make relevant offline maps available for download from your Butter Box.

Learn more about how to share maps and use static websites (and content packs) to feature content in the [Customization](../customization/) section.

## Media, Files and Digital Books

You can use your Butter Box to share media, files, and digital books. The simplest way is by placing files or folders directly on your USB drive.

If you‚Äôd like more control over how your content is displayed, you can build a **static HTML site** and share it through the Butter Box. Learn more in the [Content Packs](../customization/content-packs.md) section.
