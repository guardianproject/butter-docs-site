# Load USB

## Media, Files and Digital Books

If you want to share media, files or digital books, simply drop them onto the USB drive. You can use folders and subfolders to organize your content.

{% hint style="info" %}
The name you give the folder will appear in your Butter Box portal.
{% endhint %}

## Html Pages

With html pages, you can create your own experience around the content you're sharing. To display content through a html page, simply add the html file and it's complementary folders to the jump drive.

If you have one html file in the main directory, the html page will appear when users tap 'Explore USB' from the portal. If you have multiple folders in the directory, the folders will appear when users tap 'Explore USB'. Once they tap into the folder that contains an hmtl file, that webpage will be displayed \[show video demo].

{% hint style="info" %}
The name you give the folder will appear in your Butter Box portal.
{% endhint %}

## Maps

If you want to share offline map files, you need to provide the latest version of Open Street Map for Android, along with the map files for locations of interest.

* Download OSM map apk for Android: [Free Releases — Android | OsmAndosmand.net](https://osmand.net/docs/versions/free-versions/?current-os=ios&)
* Download OSM map files: [Osmand Local Indexes Listdownload.osmand.net](https://download.osmand.net/list.php)

Put these all in a folder named **osm-map-files**. Place that folder on your Butter Box USB drive.

## Apps

If you want to share apps from your Butter Box, you can create a repo for F-Droid (most secure) or feature apps and app downloads from an html page. Learn more about F-Droid ... / Go to section **x** for full information about using the F-Droid web interface on the box to share.&#x20;

Use an html page to display: To load your drive via html page with apps, do this:

* Create a folder called **‘appstore**’. Put it in the main directory on your USB drive. Within that file place your html file with the apk files in the same folder or subfolder. When you insert your USB drive into the Butter Box, the App Store tile will show up in the portal.
* Note: You will need to develop your own local html page.&#x20;
* Note: You will need to download the app files. Apps are updated frequently. Be sure to manually update all of the app files frequently to ensure you are providing the highest security for the people who connect to the box.
* Note: Be sure to download apps from trusted sources.

As an alternative, you can simply share apk files directly on the USB the same way you can share media, files and digital books.
