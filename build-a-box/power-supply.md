## Different Ways To Power Your Box&#x20;

Butter Boxes can be powered by a wall outlet, pre-charged battery pack or solar powered battery pack.

* **Wall Outlet:** The official and recommended power supply for Raspberry Pi computers (depends of the Raspberry Pi model that you are using)
* **Pre-charged Battery Pack (Power Bank):** This is the most common option for field use.
* **Solar Panel (with Power Bank):** Use a small solar panel to recharge your power bank. This is a good option to keep the box running continuously in off-grid locations. Using direct solar panel without a battery is possible, but unstable if the sun dips in/out.
