# Power Supply

If you want Butter to work completely off-grid and without electricity, it can! Butter Boxes can be powered by a wall outlet, pre-charged battery pack or solar powered battery pack.

* **Wall Outlet:** The official and recommended power supply for Raspberry Pi computers (depends of the Raspberry Pi model that you are using)
* **Pre-charged Battery Pack (Power Bank):** This is the most common option for field use.
  * Anker portable charger [power bank](https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Portable-PowerCore-High-Speed-Charging/dp/B09VXF29RM/ref=sr_1_6?crid=30EJM6E540GE6\&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.cMM86su3KXjp8lN7z7mvmL1HERSowjwoegVu1E_8xhH-Pl38rDD2hEv21fVqk-w2eogpdZGsfiLn_V8ij-PvaRw3RDBdv9-NTKTFqGOUj6IZJKMdbeUjGkgBFVFdZvyOkBFF6kau0uJIE-rRQyseWiNNPxZwan-29xuz2_f643gTOfOzERBuVK2cDdpm91rPdVsRl3dKy6iR1K7qkYW5YGTtYpaZWriYGWOovD2CcVA.SogXwrCYRlPyAkf0wzwye8_-ZdVw-Fi0EcM5vcr7ESk\&dib_tag=se\&keywords=anker%2Bpower%2Bbank%2Bbattery%2Bpack%2Bwhite\&qid=1756265405\&sprefix=anker%2Bpower%2Bbank%2Bbattery%2Bpack%2Bwhit%2Caps%2C154\&sr=8-6\&th=1)&#x20;
* **Solar Panel (with Power Bank):** Use a small solar panel to recharge your power bank. This is a good option to keep the box running continuously in off-grid locations. Using direct solar panel without a battery is possible, but unstable if the sun dips in/out.
