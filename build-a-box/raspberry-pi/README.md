# Raspberry Pi

The section covers the setup and supplies required to build your own box with the Raspberry Pi hardware. You have 2 options:

1. [Basic Box](./#basic-box-supply-list) (Up to 10 people, About 10 meters apart)
2. [Extended Box](./#extended-box-supply-list) (Up to 20 people, About 30 meters apart)

## Basic Box Supply List

* Raspberry Pi Zero 2W (64 Bit) [https://www.adafruit.com/product/5291](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5291); Or you can buy a kit here: [\

* Power Cord that accompanies the Raspberry Pi Zero 2W
* Micro SD Card: Images are usually under 16 GB (we suggest 256 GB). Media that people upload to the chat ends up on the card; it never gets cleared.&#x20;
* USB drive (min 32 GB)
* Adapters:
  * Micro USB/Male to USB A/Female
  * A dongle to connect the micro SD card to your laptop (if needed)

**About**

A basic Butter Box setup is a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W with a microSD card running the Butter software, a USB stick, powered by a USB source like a power cord, power bank or solar panel.

In most setups like this, a Butter Box can comfortably handle &#x34;**–10 connected devices at once** without slowing down. It’s possible to have more, but performance may drop if everyone is downloading large files or videos at the same time.

The reach for it is about **5–10 meters** indoors, depending on the Raspberry Pi model and depending on walls and interference. Outdoors, in open space, it can sometimes reach farther. Think of it like the range of a home Wi-Fi router — enough to cover a classroom, a coffee shop, meeting space, or small outdoor gathering.

**About**

An extended Butter Box pairs the Raspberry Pi with a standalone Wi-Fi router, giving stronger signal and more simultaneous connections. For this option, you’ll want a Raspberry Pi model that has an ethernet port, this means a **Raspberry Pi 4** or a **Raspberry Pi 5**.

With the router, the network can reach **10-30 m**, like a city block or a park, and can comfortably support **10–20 connected devices** at the same time per router (but you can add more routers to it).

This setup is ideal for medium group of people in a medium room, like classrooms, events, or community spaces like a church.

**Instructions**

* To use the router as a hub for the Butter Box, connect the Raspberry Pi to the router by plugging one end of the given ethernet cable into the LAN port and the other into the Raspberry Pi .

## Power Supply Options

If you want Butter to work completely off-grid and without electriciy,  it can! Learn more in the [Power Supply](../power-supply.md) section.
