# Basic Box Supplies

A basic Butter Box setup is a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W with a microSD card running the Butter software, a USB stick, powered by a USB source like a power cord, power bank or solar panel.

In most setups like this, a Butter Box can comfortably handle **4–10 connected devices at once** without slowing down. It’s possible to have more, but performance may drop if everyone is downloading large files or videos at the same time.

The reach for it is about **5–10 meters** indoors, depending on the Raspberry Pi model and depending on walls and interference. Outdoors, in open space, it can sometimes reach farther. Think of it like the range of a home Wi-Fi router — enough to cover a classroom, a coffee shop, meeting space, or small outdoor gathering.

## Supplies

* [ ] Raspberry Pi Zero 2W (64 Bit) [https://www.adafruit.com/product/5291](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5291); Or you can buy a kit here: [\

* [ ] Power Cord that accompanies the Raspberry Pi Zero 2W or an [alternative power supply](../power-supply.md)
* [ ] Micro SD Card: Images with the Butter software are usually under 16 GB (we suggest 256 GB). Media that people upload to the chat ends up on the card; it never gets cleared.&#x20;
* [ ] USB drive (min 32 GB)
*   [ ] Adapters (as needed)

    * [ ] Micro USB/Male to USB A/Female
    * [ ] A dongle to connect the micro SD card to your laptop (if needed)
