# Extended Box Supplies

An extended Butter Box pairs the Raspberry Pi with a standalone Wi-Fi router, giving stronger signal and more simultaneous connections. For this option, you’ll want a Raspberry Pi model that has an ethernet port, this means a **Raspberry Pi 4** or a **Raspberry Pi 5**.

With the router, the network can reach **10-30 m**, like a city block or a park, and can comfortably support **10–20 connected devices** at the same time per router (but you can add more routers to it).

This setup is ideal for medium group of people in a medium room, like classrooms, events, or community spaces like a church.

## Supplies

* [ ] Raspberry Pi 4&#x20;
* [ ] Power Cord that accompanies the Raspberry Pi 4 or an [alternative power supply](../power-supply.md)
* [ ] Router ([Opal (GL-SFT1200) Wireless Travel Router](https://store-us.gl-inet.com/products/united-states-opal-gl-sft1200-gigabit-wireless-router-dual-band-openwrt-ipv6-tor) or equivilent)
* [ ] Micro SD Card: Images with the Butter software are usually under 16 GB (we suggest 256 GB). Media that people upload to the chat ends up on the card; it never gets cleared.
* [ ] USB Drive (min 32 GB)
